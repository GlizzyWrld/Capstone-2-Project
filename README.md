a. Title of site & link to where it is deployed

b. Barkipedia is meant for educational purposes. It allows users to learn about dogs in a fun calming way. The app allows for users to create a profile and save facts to view and or come back to at a later time. 

c. I implemented a feature that allows users to generate dog facts from an existing API. Once the facts have been generated there is an option to save each fact to the users profile. Another feature that I implemented is the Facts of the Day(FOD) page, which allows anyone to see the facts of the day along with pictures of dogs. The facts of the day page will show a new fact along with a generated dog image from another existing API every 90 seconds. I chose these features because I felt like many people love dogs and would like to learn more about them in a fun and cool way. Also the fact of the day feature was created for things like waiting rooms, classrooms, or even rooms where people are quiet such as libraries.

d. My tests are nest within each folder for the specific component or route. The tests can be ran using 'npm test' for all tests or 'npm test <filename.>' for a specific file to be ran.

e. The standard user flow would look like this: Starting at the beginning, a user would be greeted at the homepage view. Then if the user was simply trying to use the FOD view (for maybe a waiting room) they would navigate to that page and just relax, learn, and enjoy the photos and facts generated every 90 seconds. On the other hand, if the user was wanted to learn facts and come back to them later, from the beginning they would be greeted as usual and then the user would navigate to the signup page. After signing up, the user would then go to the facts page where only created users can get new facts on command and save them to their profile. Also if the user wanted to change their username or delete their account they could do so at the profile page.

g. I used the MERN stack to create my website. MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS.
